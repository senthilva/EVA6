# Modified MNIST for Classification and Addition

The objective is not only predict the number from the MNIST dataset , but also predict the sum of the random number(0-9) added to it.

## Input Data prep-processing

Build a combined dataset using

*  torchvision MNIST
*  Add random numbers between 0-9 as the second input
*  2 outputs : predicted number and sum of predicted number and random number provided as input


# Network Design

* Convolution block using the image as input
* **After the convolution add the 2nd input : random number**
* Pass the ouput and random number (input2) through linear layers
* No activation function required during addition of two numbers as it is a linear function

  ```
  The model layers are: 
  Network(
    (input1): Conv2d(1, 16, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1))
    (conv1): Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1))
    (conv2): Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1))
    (pool): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
    (oneconv1): Conv2d(64, 16, kernel_size=(1, 1), stride=(1, 1))
    (conv3): Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1))
    (conv4): Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1))
    (conv5): Conv2d(64, 64, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1))
    (conv6): Conv2d(64, 10, kernel_size=(5, 5), stride=(1, 1))
    (input2): Linear(in_features=2, out_features=5, bias=True)
    (layer1): Linear(in_features=5, out_features=5, bias=True)
    (out2): Linear(in_features=5, out_features=1, bias=True)
  )

  Shape of parameters in each layer is: 
  input1.weight 		 torch.Size([16, 1, 3, 3])
  input1.bias 		 torch.Size([16])
  conv1.weight 		 torch.Size([32, 16, 3, 3])
  conv1.bias 		 torch.Size([32])
  conv2.weight 		 torch.Size([64, 32, 3, 3])
  conv2.bias 		 torch.Size([64])
  oneconv1.weight 		 torch.Size([16, 64, 1, 1])
  oneconv1.bias 		 torch.Size([16])
  conv3.weight 		 torch.Size([32, 16, 3, 3])
  conv3.bias 		 torch.Size([32])
  conv4.weight 		 torch.Size([64, 32, 3, 3])
  conv4.bias 		 torch.Size([64])
  conv5.weight 		 torch.Size([64, 64, 3, 3])
  conv5.bias 		 torch.Size([64])
  conv6.weight 		 torch.Size([10, 64, 5, 5])
  conv6.bias 		 torch.Size([10])
  input2.weight 		 torch.Size([5, 2])
  input2.bias 		 torch.Size([5])
  layer1.weight 		 torch.Size([5, 5])
  layer1.bias 		 torch.Size([5])
  out2.weight 		 torch.Size([1, 5])
  out2.bias 		 torch.Size([1])
  ```
 
## Training and Loss

* Number of epochs : 10
* Loss - as there are 2 components - image detection and sum - 2 loss functions are used 
  * cross entropy and mean square error both with equal weights

## Observations/ Learning

* The model is able to predict the number and the sum very well
* Equal weightages were given to both the losses - which helped
* No activation function was used during addition of two numbers as it was a linear function
